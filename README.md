# saltbridges
analyzing the saltbridges obtained by simulation and give the time series with a binary value, where 1 is when the bridge is present and  when is not, during the simulation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Instructions

- 1.Make sure your data for each bridge analyzed is in a file.dat (see example.1) and that the file name correspond to the name of the two aminoacids that are interacting.
- 2. The files need to be in the same directory that here is called 'saltbridges' specified in 'folder'. 
You should put your file in a new directory called saltbridges or change the variable 'folder' with the directory where your files are. 
- 3.  Run the script with the command 
- python saltbridtest.py


## Data File Format

- The data files should have the `.dat` extension.
- Make sure that all the salt bridge data files in `.dat` format are present in the same folder as the `saltbridtest.py` file.
